We strongly recommend that pregnant women consider taking our courses at a different time instead. Our yoga teacher training courses are not a suitable prenatal yoga practice unless you are a very experienced and seasoned practitioner. Please note: traditionally in Ashtanga yoga, women are not meant to practice during pregnancy and the first three months after giving birth. If you already have a well-established daily yoga practice, you can come take the course and modify accordingly. Please contact us before booking and we will discuss this together.

We advise students to fly from New Delhi (DEL) to Dehradun (DED) airport. Rishikesh is just 20 kilometers away from Dehradun airport, which takes about 45 minutes and costs Rs 900 approximately by taxi. If you would like to book a taxi, either from the New Delhi Airport or from the Dehradun Airport, we can organize this for you for an additional fee. Please keep in mind that a taxi trip from New Delhi to Rishikesh can take anywhere from 5-10hrs dependent on traffic.

January is definitely the coldest. When it comes to clothing, think layers, socks and sweaters! The sky is partially cloudy and mornings can be very foggy.

<br><br>It gets pleasant in February and a lot of blue skies dominate, but days can still be a bit chilly. Sightseeing and adventurous activities like trekking can be enjoyed during this month. Long sleeves, trousers, and warmer clothes for nighttimes are highly recommended.

<br><br>Moderately hot during day and nights with a slightly cool breeze, March in Rishikesh is the best time to enjoy rafting and other outdoor adventure pursuits. This is especially a good month for yogis as the international yoga festival takes place at this time. One can pack lighter clothing items during this time.

<br><br>It’s getting hotter in April. Outdoor activities can be still enjoyed as the heat is still within most people’s comfort zone. Short sleeves and skirts can be used, but please remember to keep your shoulders and knees covered. Take a dip in the Ganga: the clear skies and plenty of sunshine make it ideal!

<br><br>It gets a bit hot in May and is often considered to be the hottest month of the year. Maybe not the best time to visit, but we think that Rishikesh is always worth a visit throughout the year.

<br><br>The hot weather during June in Rishikesh melts the ice in the northern region, feeding the streams of Rishikesh and raising the water levels.

<br><br>Monsoon season starts in July where it gets cooler. There will be cloudy skies most days and increasing humidity, but still manageable. It’s the perfect month for nature enthusiasts, but do not forget to bring your rain gear.

<br><br>The wettest month, August is fantastic for people who like rain. Stunning shades of green for our rain lovers during this season. The days are warm and the evenings are pleasant. Bring your rain gear!

<br><br>September is a moderate month. The month is ideal for outdoor travels and enjoyed by most tourists because of clear skies and plenty of sunshine. Days can be hot, so bring your light clothing items.

<br><br>Humid and cool, October is one of the best months to visit Rishikesh. You will love doing yoga during this time. Warm during the day and evenings begin to get cooler.

<br><br>November is perfect for enjoying indoor and outdoor activities. Winter starts at the end of the month but there will still be plenty of sunshine. Plan to layer up clothing, especially in the mornings and evenings.

<br><br>Nights are getting cool in December and winter is coming to town. But still, days are pretty comfortable. Again, think layers and keep yourself warm. Mornings and evenings can get cold!

This is a good question! Of course you want to know if you will be in a small group or in a group of 100 people! Each month, the amount of people attending our yoga courses vary. As COVID19 has changed our courses drastically, we are unsure how to best answer this question at this time. We will say that generally, prior to COVID, anywhere from 8-20 people have attended our courses during any given month.
